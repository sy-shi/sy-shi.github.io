I am a senior student from the school of **Mechanical Engineering**, Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
My research interest lies in **the control of robotic systems**, especially the control of
**collaborative multi-robot systems**.
In my opinion, control is a key to guaranteeing safe task completion under various disturbances in real situations.
I envision a future where robots, and maybe teams of them, flexibly and safely accomplish human commands and intelligently
interact with human beings.
