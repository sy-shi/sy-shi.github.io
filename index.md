I am a senior student at the school of **Mechanical Engineering**, Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
My research interest lies in **collaborative multi-robot systems**, especially their planning and
control.
In my opinion, collaborative robotic systems have great potential for future applications because they can
accomplish tasks far beyond the capability of a single robot.
