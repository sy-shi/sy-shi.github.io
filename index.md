<!-- ## Statement
I am passionate about developing innovative robotics applications that can execute human commands with flexibility and advanced intelligence.
My research interest lies in the **control and planning** of robotic systems, especially **collaborative multi-robot systems**.
I hope to build robot teams that can flexibly and safely accomplish human commands and intelligently interact with human beings.
<br/> <br/>
I would like to develop methods based on control theory, distributed algorithms, and artificial intelligence,
and draw inspiration from any other regions. -->
