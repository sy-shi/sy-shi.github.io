I am a senior student at the school of **Mechanical Engineering**, Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
My research interest lies in the **planning and control** of robotic systems, especially of
**collaborative multi-robot systems**. In my opinion, collaborative robotic systems
have great potential for future applications because they can accomplish tasks far
beyond the capability of a single robot.
