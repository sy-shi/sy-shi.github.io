MATLAB/Simulink.

This is a project of ME385(Robotics) of SJTU. In industrial scenarios, manipulators
are always deployed to carry heavy things and stack them in a specific order. We take
the UR-10 manipulator as an example, setting up a stacking task and studying its
<strong>dynamics, control, and planning</strong>.</p>

### Dyanmics and Kinematics

<p align="justify">Based on the <strong>product of exponentials (POE)</strong> approach, we developed the kinematics of
UR-10, and verified our method with MATLAB/SIMULINK <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/products/robotics.html">robotic toolbox</a>.</p>

<p align="justify">To control the manipulator, we need to establish its dynamics. In this
project, the dynamics in joint space were derived based on the <strong>Euler-Lagrange formulation</strong>
to enable a computed torque controller. And we also tested its performance with SIMULINK.</p>

### control

<p align="justify">Cargo is attached to the end of the manipulator during the stacking process. Thus,
the manipulator's mass matrix must be modified to control the manipulator
when it is loaded. We modeled this based on the simplification of the inertia matrix and
developed a controller.
The <strong>computed</strong> torque controller** was designed as:
\begin{equation}
u(t) = M(q)(\ddot{q}_d + K_p \tilde{q} + K_d \tilde{q}) + C(q,\dot{q})\dot{q} + G(q)
\end{equation}
with compensation adjusted by parameters \( K_p \) and \(K_d\).</p>

### Path Planning
<img src="/project/ur10-nav/assets/img/apf.jpg" style="zoom:60%; display:block; margin:10px auto;" />
<p align="justify">To avoid collision with fixed environmental obstacles, we implemented a path
planning algorithm to calculate a short and reasonable path for the manipulator
in the joint space. Meanwhile, <strong>self-collision</strong> can not be ignored. To tackle this,
We designed an <strong>artificial potential field (APF)</strong> and defined the repulsive force
between obstacles and links, links and links. To escape from local minima, we utilized
a tracking back strategy. And we also used low-pass filters to smooth the calculated
path.</p>

### Trajectory Planning
<p align="justify">After generating control points of the path in the joint space, the shortest time trajectory planning was conducted
with sampling first to reduce the dimension of the following optimization problem.
Based on cubic splines, the problem was formulated as SQP procedures:

$$ \min T = \min_{\Delta t_j} \sum_{1}^n \Delta t_j $$

and it was solved with MATLAB <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/optim/ug/fmincon.html">fmincon</a>
function.</p>
