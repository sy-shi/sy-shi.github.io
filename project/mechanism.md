This research was conducted in a student research training group advised by<a href = "https://me.sjtu.edu.cn/teacher_directory1/chenweixing.html">Prof. Weixing Chen</a>.
Aiming to improve AUVs' task endurance
in the desolated and uninhabited marine environment with restricted pre-storage
energy, we designed a vehicle with <strong>foldable wings</strong> to convert wave energy into
electricity.

### Novelty in Mechanism
<img src="/project/mechanism/assets/img/oneway.jpg" style="zoom:100%; display:block; margin:10px auto;" />
<p align="justify">
To produce continuous one-way rotation in the generator and improve efficiency,
a <strong>reciprocation into one-way motion mechanism</strong> was designed. It is a gearbox
with multiple one-way bearings connecting the shaft of wings and the generator.

### Validation
<p align="justify">
Power analysis was conducted in MATLAB. A dynamic model was established based on
the <strong>Lagrange method and Cummings equation</strong>. Then, <strong>parameter identification</strong>
was made to settle all the coefficients. Finally, the maximum calculated power
generated by the mechanism was over 50W on an AUV of about 85W.
