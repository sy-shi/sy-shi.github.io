>We designed and implemented a double-tracked ground vehicle to climb obstacles

This is the project of obstacle climbing competition in ME209(Mechanism) of SJTU.
We designed ground vehicles in order to conquer obstacles of certain heights and
shapes. The size of the robots was restricted, and payloads were required during
the tasks.

### Mechanism

<p align="justify">
We designed a tracked vehicle in order to maintain high mobility while having
good adaptiveness to different obstacles. In order to reduce self-weight and size,
we modeled an <strong>LP problem</strong> and optimized the robot's shape with <a href="https://www.gurobi.com/">Gurobi</a>.
And we designed proper shafts and gearboxes to improve its loading ability.</p>

### Prototype
We built a prototype for the obstacle climbing competition.
