Currently, I am remotely leading this research project in the Cognitive Robotics and
AI [(CRAI)](https://ruiliurobotics.weebly.com/) lab, Kent State Unviersity under the supervision
of [Prof. Rui Liu](https://www.kent.edu/cae/rui-liu-ph-d). Inspired by the **herding behavior**
in animals and the **opinion manipulation** in marketing, we believe large-scale robotic crowd can also be
efficiently manipulated via several **critical agents**. Up to now, the problem and method
have been formulated, and we are working to prove its efficiency and implement it
based on neural networks.
