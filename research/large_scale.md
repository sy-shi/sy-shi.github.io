>A social-network informed method for large-scale collective behavior manipulation.

Currently, I am remotely leading this research project in the Cognitive Robotics and
AI [(CRAI)](https://ruiliurobotics.weebly.com/) lab, Kent State Unviersity, under the supervision
of [Prof. Rui Liu](https://www.kent.edu/cae/rui-liu-ph-d). Inspired by the **herding behavior**
in animals and the **opinion manipulation** in marketing, we believe large-scale robotic crowds can also be
efficiently manipulated via several **critical agents**.

### Method
We designed a distributed learning paradigm informed by social topology to **elect**
critical agents based on their ability and power, and collaboratively propagate
intended collective behaviors to other robots. Compared with other collective behavior
manipulation methods, our method has better performance in scalability and efficiency.

Now we are working on the proof of its effectiveness and building simulation environments.
