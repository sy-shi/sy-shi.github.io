This research was conducted in a student research training group advised by
[Prof. Weixing Chen](https://me.sjtu.edu.cn/teacher_directory1/chenweixing.html).
Aiming to improve AUVs' task endurance
in the desolated and uninhabited marine environment with restricted pre-storage
energy, we designed a vehicle with **foldable wings** to convert wave energy into
electricity.

### Novelty in Mechanism
<img src="assets/img/oneway.jpg" style="zoom:100%; display:block; margin:10px auto;" />
To produce continuous one-way rotation in the generator and improve efficiency,
a **reciprocation into one-way motion mechanism** was designed. It is a gearbox
with multiple one-way bearings connecting the shaft of wings and the generator.

### Validation
Power analysis was conducted in MATLAB. A dynamic model was established based on
the **Lagrange method and Cummings equation**. Then, **parameter identification**
was made to settle all the coefficients. Finally, the maximum calculated power
generated by the mechanism was over 50W on an AUV of about 85W.
