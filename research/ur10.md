>We accomplished the terminal motion of a stacking task with a UR-10 manipulator in
MATLAB/Simulink.

This is a project of ME385(Robotics) of SJTU. In industrial scenarios, manipulators
are always deployed to carry heavy things and stack them in a certain order. We take
the UR-10 manipulator as an example, setting up a stacking task and studying its
**dynamics, control and planning**.

### Dyanmics and Kinematics

Based on the **product of exponentials (POE)** method, we developed the kinematics of
UR-10, and verified our method with MATLAB/SIMULINK robotic tools.

In order to control the manipulator, we need to establish its dynamics. In this
project, the dynamics in joint space was derived based on the **Euler-Lagrange formulation**
to enable a computed torque controller. And we also tested its performace with SIMULINK.

### control

Cargo is attached to the end of the manipulator during the stacking process. Thus,
the mass matrix of the manipulator is required to be modified to control the manipulator
when it is loaded. We modeled this based on the simpification of inertia matrix and
developed a controller.
The **computed torque controller** was designed as:
\begin{equation}
u(t) = M(q)(\ddot{q}_d + K_p \tilde{q} + K_d \tilde{q}) + C(q,\dot{q})\dot{q} + G(q)
\end{equation}
with compensation adjusted by parameters $$K_p$$ and $$K_d$$.

### Path Planning
<img src="assets/img/apf.jpg" style="zoom:60%; display:block; margin:10px auto;" />
To avoid collision with fixed obstacles in the environment, we implemented a path
planning algorithm to calculate a short and reasonable path for the manipulator
in the joint space. Meanwhile, **self-collision** can not be ignored. To tackle this,
We designed an **artificial potential field (APF)** and definee the repulsive force
between obstacles and links, links and links. To escape from local minima, we utilized
a tracking back strategy. And we also utilized low-pass filters to smooth the calculated
path.

### Trajectory Planning
After generating control points of path in the joint space, the shortest time trajectory planning was conducted
with sampling first to reduce the dimension of the following optimization problem.
Based on cubic splines, the problem was formulated as SQP procedures:

$$ \min T = \min_{\Delta t_j} \sum_{1}^n \Delta t_j $$

and it was solved with MATLAB [`fmincon`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/optim/ug/fmincon.html)
function.
